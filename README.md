# HER_Tafel_ML
Prediction of Standardized Tafel Slope of HER for Pt based nanocatalytsts


## Additional Resources
An open-access web tool implementing our standardization method is also available at http://deep4chem.korea.ac.kr/ExtractTafel, enabling users to reproduce and apply the method to their own polarization curve data. An example input file is provided in this repository (Polarization_Curve_data_Example_for_Extractor.xlsx) so that users can easily test and reproduce the standardization workflow.
